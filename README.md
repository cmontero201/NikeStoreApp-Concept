# NikeStoreApp-Concept
The application has been tested on iPhone XS Max, iPhone XS, and iPhoneXr (12.2).

Attached you will find the Xcode work folder. Click the project that is white (.xcworkspace), not blue. Additionally you will find a power point presentation video, a powerpoint file, and the demonstration video.

Current Issues:
	- Lagging in favorite/cart buttons within dashboard. The buttons will not active/switch state until another button is tapped.
	- The first build of the application always fails. The second always succeeds.
